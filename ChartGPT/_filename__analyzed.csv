bryantjames@example.com,"As someone who has struggled with anxiety and stress for years, I've found Welltory to be incredibly helpful. The app's stress tracking and HRV analysis have helped me better understand my body's response to stress, and the guided meditations and breathing exercises have been a lifesaver when I'm feeling overwhelmed.",2023-01-15,10

robertbautista@example.net,"Welltory is a decent app, but I find the HRV measurements to be a bit finicky. I often have trouble getting a good reading, and the app can be a bit frustrating to use as a result. The stress tracking and guided meditations are helpful, though.",2023-01-20,6
kevin03@example.com,"Welltory is okay, but I'm not sure it's worth the price. The free version of the app is quite limited, and the paid version doesn't offer much more in terms of features. I do appreciate the stress tracking and HRV analysis, but I'm not sure it's worth the monthly subscription fee.",2023-01-12,5

While the app provides some interesting data about my health, I didn't find it particularly useful in terms of making meaningful changes in my life. The guided meditations and breathing exercises were okay, but I didn't find them to be any better than other meditation apps out there.",2023-02-04,5
spearsjamie@example.org,"I was really disappointed with Welltory. The HRV measurements were wildly inconsistent, and the app was constantly crashing. I also found the recommendations to be quite generic and not very helpful. I ended up cancelling my subscription after just a few weeks.",2023-02-05,1
